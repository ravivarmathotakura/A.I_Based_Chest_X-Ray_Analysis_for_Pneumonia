# Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases(Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays) by Image-Based Deep Learning using Neural Networks

# Summary
The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.
